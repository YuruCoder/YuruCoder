# Code Skill Goal

## Web Service

Well, I learned these skills from the [Wetube](https://github.com/YuruCoder/wetube) project at [Nomad Coders](https://nomadcoders.co/wetube). <br>
Thanks to [Nico](https://github.com/serranoarevalo)!

- Frontend : JS/Pug/Sass
- Backend : Node/Express
- Database : MongoDB

## Graphics Editor

I love games, especially JRPGs and Visual Novels. <br>
So I thought of some useful tools to make a game!

- Flutter : The simplest way to use Skia
- Unreal Engine : The best graphics engine!
